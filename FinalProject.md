# Eng334 Project

I plan to use this github repository as a platform to publish my opinions in regards to reform that I believe should take place within the U.S. government. It is my opinion that the U.S. is overdue for massive reform in a many areas, but I would like to focus on the Health Care System, our Military, our Judicial Systems, and our Education System.

I would like to first point out about our expenditure that our military spending accounts for 16% which as the next chart shows is number one in the world by far. (the next graph reflects military spending albeit from a different yea, but still consistent with the last 10 years of military spending)
![Military Expenditure by Country](https://i.imgur.com/0XOGMSR.png)
This graph shows that our military spending accounts for almost 50% of the total worlds spending on military. Is that responsible? What sort of ROI are we getting on this sort of spending?

Another spending issue I think needs to be addressed is in regards to healthcare. I think we need to inspect our healthcare system I look make changes that improve our healthcare standing in the world community.

As you can see we spend the most in the wold per capita on healthcare yet rank 38th according the metrics WHO uses to judge Health Care rankings.

Another thing I have on my mind is the role the media plays in the U.S. and if perhaps this is another system that needs reform. It seems like today's media is operating with their business ethics coming before their reporting ethics. It seems like today's media incentivizes clicks and this leads to clickbaity material. I think it might be beneficail for one to question if this is the best way for a media to operate and I would propose that perhaps something closer to the British Broadcasting Channel system may be more effective. I think this conversation envitable leads to talks in regards to other systems that aren't particuaraly moral under capitalism, eg in my opinion schools, prisons, and hospitals also shouldnâ€™t operate solely for profit. If that is the case they begin to incentivize the wrong things. For example a for profit hospital might make more money off a sickly patient than if they were to cure them. A for profit school incentives getting students to pay money, not providing the best education. A for profit prison incentives keeping those cells full. In my opinion, these are some of the the systems in our government that need deep examination.

You can create something similar to this with your own opinions simply by creating a github account(you'll need an email) and then creating a new repo named whatever you would like. By analyzing the 'raw material' of this repo you can replicate the format to create your own project. If you would like to go into more indepth website creation I would suggest studying web-development as it is a subject too vast for this project and a plethora of free resources are accessible through a google search.
